## Software Testing

### Jest vs React Testing Library

When it comes to testing React applications, two popular choices are Jest and React Testing Library. Here's a comparison between the two:

#### Jest

- Jest is a powerful testing framework that is widely used in the React community.
- It provides a rich set of features for writing and running tests, including support for mocking, code coverage, and snapshot testing.
- Jest has a built-in test runner and assertion library, making it easy to write and execute tests.
- It also integrates well with other tools commonly used in the React ecosystem, such as Babel and webpack.

#### React Testing Library

- React Testing Library, on the other hand, focuses on testing the behavior of React components from the user's perspective.
- It encourages writing tests that closely resemble how a user would interact with the application.
- React Testing Library provides a simple and intuitive API for querying and interacting with components, making it easy to write readable and maintainable tests.
- It promotes best practices for testing accessibility and encourages testing components in isolation.
